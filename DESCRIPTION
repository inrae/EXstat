Description: Ash is a toolbox of R code that perfoms a stationarity
	     analysis of the low water regime which in french is
	     'analyse de stationnarité du régime des étiages'. In this
	     configuration, this analysis is centered on the
	     Adour-Garonne hydrological basin which is located in the
	     south-west part of France.
